# Arduino Robot
Arduino code for an Arduino robot with Bluetooth control and obstacle avoidance mode using sonar range finder. I am also in the process of adding a webcam and a Raspberry Pi with an OpenCV based application for computer vision. I intend to make the robot follow a ball around.

Components of the robot:

- Arduino Uno
- Raspberry Pi running OpenCV
- Adafruit Motor Shield v2.3
- DFRobot Pirate 4WD robot chassis
- BlueSmirf bluetooth module
- SRF08 Sonar Ranging module
- Bluetooth RC Car Controller (free on Google Play Store)
- Webcam 

A work in progress...
